 * 
 * Welcome to the types.ts file - the foundation of our TypeScript architecture! üèóÔ∏è
 * 
 * This file defines all the data structures, interfaces, and types used throughout
 * the application. Think of it as the DNA that shapes how data flows through the app.
 * 
 * Why is this file important?
 * - It ensures type safety across the entire application
 * - It provides autocomplete and IntelliSense in your IDE
 * - It documents the shape of our data for all team members
 * - It creates a single source of truth for data structures
 * 
 * When adding new features, you'll likely need to extend these types.
 * Please keep related types grouped together and maintain the existing organization.
